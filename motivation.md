# Motivation

**Highlight coding techniques and styles I have found in my experience that help to prevent bugs and create stable, maintable code.**

I've been coding for decades.   That is not what motivated me to compile this list of opinions though.  I have had to debug lots of problems that can be traced back to nothing more than confusing, obfuscated, bloated, hard to read code.
Many times I have made fix that is as simple as adding a comma or a pair of braces.  Other times there are patterns that are repeated over the life of a code base that were just wrong to begin with but permeated the code base with copy and paste speed and simplicity.  I think of this as cleaning up a mess not of my own making.

Here I hope you find some things you may be debating with your team or just trying to find a good way to do something.  Or clean up a mess.

You don't have to do it this way but you can take a minute and consider why some old guy took the time to write down these thoughts.

My first job was on IBM mainframes.  My first day on the job the ICM CEs were upgrading the memory on the machine from 8Mb to 16Mb.  The computer, the only computer at the company, was down for a couple of hours while they opened up the doors and connected some wires.  Later I was told the bill was around USD2,000,000.  My first 6 months, almost every day I sat shoulder to should with my boss watching him work, asking him questions and occasionally getting a small assignment to go do something.  Today we would call that pair programming.  When the TRS-80 was the personal computer standard we just called it working together.

I eventually surpassed him in technical skill because I really just loved the work.  He was more interested in moving up the org chart.  We were both happy.  In the decades since I really don't feel I have had to work a day for a paycheck.  I hope you love your job as much.
