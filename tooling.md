# Tooling

**Keep your toolset as small and simple as possible.**

**Use Visual Studio and VS Code as much as possible.**

**Document local developer setup or better yet, script the tooling installation.  Keep it up to date.**

I have worked almost exclusively in the Microsoft technology stack since shortly before the millenium.  As such I am a bit biased about tools and my worldview is accordingly framed.  That said ...

My primary tools for coding are Visual Studio and VS Code.

I thought about stopping there but realized I need to explain why.

First, I have been using what we call Visual Studio since it was called [Visual C++](https://archive.org/details/ms-vc20).  I have learned the shortcuts, explored the new features, written tons of code and rather enjoyed the continuous improvements in the tool and amazing things that I've built with it.

Recently I have adopted VS Code for quick editing of text-ish files that is more feature-rich than notepad or notepad++.

Are these the best tools?  In some ways yes, in some ways no.  But they are tools I have learned to use to their fullest.  There is a lot of value in learning how tools work, but face it, too many tools makes it hard to build, hard to onboard new people, requires context switching.

VS Code is nice but I seriously doubt that anyone has the exact same setup as anyone else.  It is just **too** customizable.  What works easily for you may be hard to replicate for anyone else.

If you have to purchase, install, manage licenses, update, learn, context switch, etc. to use a bespoke tool, ask yourself if it is really worth asking everyone in the team to learn that.  Will you have this besploe tool on your next team?

I believe you'll still have Visual Studio and VS Code on your next team.
